# MikeySense

Python code for the Sense Hat for Raspberry Pis

## Uses

This uses pyowm (<https://github.com/csparpa/pyowm>) as a wrapper for OpenWeatherMap (<https://openweathermap.org/>)

## Installation

Just run /install.py, with sudo privilieges. As this is for the Sense hat, it goes without saying that this requires the Sense hat.
